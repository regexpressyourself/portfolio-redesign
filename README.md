## Introduction

Practice Buddy is currently in development. The final product will consist of three major components: modes, chords, and charts. The components are detailed below.


## Getting Started

```
   git clone https://github.com/regexpressyourself/portfolio-redesign.git messina-sam-portfolio 
   cd messina-sam-portfolio
   yarn install
   yarn run start
```

   That's it! Your development server is running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
   
   Webpack is configured with hot reloading, so any changes saved to source files will be immediately reflected in the browser.

### Production Build

To build a production version of the app, with all React code loaded into a bundled, minified Javascript file, you need to run the `production` script declared in package.json.

```
   yarn run production
```

   This will leave you with an `index.html` and an `index_bundle.js` file in the build directory. Hosting these files from the same location will serve the production build of Practice Buddy.
